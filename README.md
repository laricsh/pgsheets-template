# PG-Sheets Template

PGSheets is a set of questions to be used as guidelines for documenting Property Graph datasets, this repository contain templates of a PGSheet in both Latex and Word document formats. 

PGSheets is inspired by 5W1H and the 5 Whyâ€™s used in journalistic writing and each section of the document answer one of the questions ***What? Where? When? Why? and How?** about the data and the answer to ***Who?*** is embedded in each one of the sections. 
A PG-Sheet should be complete, clear and concise and should contain all needed information about the property graph for a reader/data-user to understand the possible pros and cons of using your data.

Each one of the sections, has a set of question which is labelled with ***MUST, SHOULD or NICE***, which means:
1. **MUST** - questions that must always be answered and included in a PGSheet
2. **SHOULD** - questions that should be answered but are not mandatory to have
3. **NICE** - questions that would be nice to have an answer in a PGSheet but can be considered optional
